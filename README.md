  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This project allows a business owner to organize and plan their buisiness through creating a database of employees, departments, and roles.

  This project was created so that way a business owner can enter all of their employees, departments, and roles information into a database to view and manipulate as they see fit.

  The business owner will add employees, departments, and roles to the database after typing `node index.js` into the command line. The business owner will then make updates to employees, departments and roles as changes need to be made. The user can also view the data in various formats when selecting the 'view' options in the menu.
